Files that work/ have info
1) fetchproblems3.ts - uses leetcode-query api to get all problems + descriptions 
2) folder context_src -> webcrawled dsa plans + all leetcode questions

I am trying to create an application that helps create a personlized dsa course when given 
1) no of days + no of hrs each day wanting to work
2) no of problems wanting to solve
Another feature would also include suggesting 2 similar questions in case user isnt able to solve a question 

The plan was to implement RAG but that will not work as I dont have the information for each dsa plan, might use simple openai
