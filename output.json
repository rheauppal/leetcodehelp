If you wish to terminate this contract, at any time you can do so by closing your account and no longer accessing or using our Services. This Contract applies to LinkedIn.com, LinkedIn-branded apps, LinkedIn Learning and other LinkedIn-related sites, apps, communications and other services that state that they are offered under this Contract (\u201cServices\u201d), including the offsite collection of data for those Services, such as our ads and the \u201cApply with LinkedIn\u201d and \u201cShare with LinkedIn\u201d plugins. Registered users of our Services are \u201cMembers\u201d and unregistered users are \u201cVisitors\u201d. You are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn (also referred to as \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d). We use the term \u201cDesignated Countries\u201d to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland.

We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you object to any changes, you may\u00a0close your account. Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date.

To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the \"Minimum Age\"(described below) or older; (2) you will only have one LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16. \u201cMinimum Age\u201d means 16 years old.

However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g. Recruiter seat bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account             If you buy any of our paid Services (\u201cPremium Services\u201d), you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and to\u00a0additional terms\u00a0specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that: You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under \u201cPurchase History\u201d.       You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Service, or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your\u00a0contact information\u00a0up to date. Please review your settings to\u00a0control and limit\u00a0messages you receive from us.       Our Services allow messaging and sharing of information in many ways, such as your profile, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages and InMails. Information and content that you share or post may be seen by other Members, Visitors or others (including off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search engines, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections network or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Service or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster. We are not obligated to publish any information or content on our Service and can remove it with or without notice. Members who were below this new Minimum Age when they started using the Services under a previous User Agreement which had allowed certain persons under 16 to use the Services, may continue to use the Services. As of June 2017 persons under the age of 16 are not eligible to use our Services.             As between you and LinkedIn, you own the content and information that you submit or post to the Services, and you are only granting LinkedIn and our\u00a0affiliates\u00a0the following non-exclusive license: A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publish and process, information and content that you provide through our Services and the services of others, without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways:       You and LinkedIn agree that we may access, store, process and use any information and personal data that you provide in accordance with, the terms of the\u00a0Privacy Policy\u00a0and your choices (including settings). By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding our Services to LinkedIn, you agree that LinkedIn can use and share (but does not have to) such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you.       You agree to only provide content or information that does not violate the law nor anyone\u2019s rights (including intellectual property rights). You also agree that your profile information will be truthful. LinkedIn may be required by law to remove certain information or content in certain countries.       We may change, suspend or discontinue any of our Services. We may also modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law. We don\u2019t promise to store or keep showing any information and content that you\u2019ve posted. LinkedIn is not a storage service. You agree that we have no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content or information that you or others provide, except to the extent required by applicable law and as noted in our Privacy Policy.             By using the Services, you may encounter content or information that might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading, illegal, offensive or otherwise harmful. LinkedIn generally does not review content provided by our Members or others. You agree that we are not responsible for others\u2019 (including other Members\u2019) content or information. We cannot always prevent this misuse of our Services, and you agree that we are not responsible for any such misuse. You also acknowledge the risk that you or your organization may be mistakenly associated with content about others when we let connections and followers know you or your organization were mentioned in the news. Members have\u00a0choices\u00a0about this\u00a0feature. LinkedIn may help connect Members offering their services (career coaching, accounting, etc.) with Members seeking services. LinkedIn does not perform nor employs individuals to perform these services. You must be at least 18 years of age to offer, perform or procure these services. You acknowledge that LinkedIn does not supervise, direct, control or monitor Members in the performance of these services and agree that (1) LinkedIn is not responsible for the offering, performance or procurement of these services, (2) LinkedIn does not endorse any particular Member\u2019s offered services, and (3) nothing shall create an employment, agency, or joint venture relationship between LinkedIn and any Member offering services. If you are a Member offering services, you represent and warrant that you have all the required licenses and will provide services consistent with our\u00a0Professional Community Policies. Similarly, LinkedIn may help you register for and/or attend events organized by Members and connect with other Members who are attendees at such events. You agree that (1) LinkedIn is not responsible for the conduct of any of the Members or other attendees at such events, (2) LinkedIn does not endorse any particular event listed on our Services, (3) LinkedIn does not review and/or vet any of these events, and (4) that you will adhere to these terms and conditions that apply to such events.       LinkedIn reserves the right to limit your use of the Services, including the number of your connections and your ability to contact other Members. LinkedIn reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your account if you breach this Contract or the law or are misusing the Services (e.g., violating any of the Dos and Don\u2019ts or\u00a0Professional Community Policies).       LinkedIn reserves all of its intellectual property rights in the Services. Trademarks and logos used in connection with the Services are the trademarks of their respective owners. LinkedIn, and \u201cin\u201d logos and other LinkedIn trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used for our Services are trademarks or registered trademarks of LinkedIn.       We use the information and data that you provide and that we have about Members to make recommendations for connections, content and features that may be useful to you. For example, we use data and information about you to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. Keeping your profile accurate and up to date helps us to make these recommendations more accurate and relevant.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, LINKEDIN AND ITS AFFILIATES DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF TITLE, ACCURACY OF DATA, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.       TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW (AND UNLESS LINKEDIN HAS ENTERED INTO A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT THAT OVERRIDES THIS CONTRACT), LINKEDIN, INCLUDING ITS AFFILIATES, WILL NOT BE LIABLE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT FOR LOST PROFITS OR LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, REPUTATION (E.G., OFFENSIVE OR DEFAMATORY STATEMENTS), LOSS OF DATA (E.G., DOWN TIME OR LOSS, USE OF, OR CHANGES TO, YOUR INFORMATION OR CONTENT) OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. LINKEDIN AND ITS AFFILIATES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT FOR ANY AMOUNT THAT EXCEEDS (A) THE TOTAL FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY YOU TO LINKEDIN FOR THE SERVICES DURING THE TERM OF THIS CONTRACT, IF ANY, OR (B) US $1000. The limitations of liability in this Section 4 are part of the basis of the bargain between you and LinkedIn and shall apply to all claims of liability (e.g., warranty, tort, negligence, contract and law) even if LinkedIn or its affiliates has been told of the possibility of any such damage, and even if these remedies fail their essential purpose. These limitations of liability do not apply to liability for death or personal injury or for fraud, gross negligence or intentional misconduct, or in cases of negligence where a material obligation has been breached, a material obligation being such which forms a prerequisite to our delivery of services and on which you may reasonably rely, but only to the extent that the damages were directly caused by the breach and were foreseeable upon conclusion of this Contract and to the extent that they are typical in the context of this Contract.       Both you and LinkedIn may terminate this Contract at any time with notice to the other. On termination, you lose the right to access or use the Services. The following shall survive termination: You can visit our\u00a0Help Center\u00a0to close your account.         If you live in the Designated Countries, the laws of Ireland govern all claims related to LinkedIn's provision of the Services, but this shall not deprive you of the mandatory consumer protections under the law of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence. With respect to jurisdiction, you and LinkedIn agree to choose the courts of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence for all disputes arising out of or relating to this User Agreement, or in the alternative, you may choose the responsible court in Ireland. If you are a business user within the scope of Article 6(12) of the EU Digital Markets Act (\u201cDMA\u201d) and have a dispute arising out of or in connection with Article 6(12) of the DMA, you may also utilize the alternative dispute resolution mechanism available in the Help Center. For others outside of Designated Countries, including those who live outside of the United States: You and LinkedIn agree that the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of laws rules, shall exclusively govern any dispute relating to this Contract and/or the Services. You and LinkedIn both agree that all claims and disputes can be litigated only in the federal or state courts in Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and LinkedIn each agree to personal jurisdiction in those courts       If a court with authority over this Contract finds any part of it unenforceable, you and we agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent. If the court cannot do that, you and we agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Contract. This Contract (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services. If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Contract, that does not mean that LinkedIn has waived its right to enforce this Contract. You may not assign or transfer this Contract (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent. However, you agree that LinkedIn may assign this Contract to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Contract. You agree that the only way to provide us legal notice is at the addresses provided in Section 10.       You agree that you will: You agree that you will\u00a0not:       We respect the intellectual property rights of others. We require that information posted by Members be accurate and not in violation of the intellectual property rights or other rights of third parties.

Central to this mission is our commitment to be transparent about the data we collect about you, how it is used and with whom it is shared. This Privacy Policy applies when you use our Services (described below). We offer our users choices about the data we collect, use and share as described in this Privacy Policy,\u00a0Cookie Policy,\u00a0Settings and our\u00a0Help Center. \ufeffSettings\u00a0are available to Members of LinkedIn and Visitors are provided\u00a0separate\u00a0controls.\u00a0Learn More.       Our registered users (\u201cMembers\u201d) share their professional identities, engage with their network, exchange knowledge and professional insights, post and view relevant content, learn and develop skills, and find business and career opportunities. Content and data on some of our Services is viewable to non-members (\u201cVisitors\u201d). We use the term \u201cDesignated Countries\u201d to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland.           This Privacy Policy applies to LinkedIn.com, LinkedIn-branded apps, LinkedIn Learning and other LinkedIn-related sites, apps, communications and services (\u201cServices\u201d), including off-site Services, such as our ad services and the \u201cApply with LinkedIn\u201d and \u201cShare with LinkedIn\u201d plugins, but excluding services that state that they are offered under a different privacy policy. For California residents, additional disclosures required by California law may be found in our\u00a0California Privacy Disclosure. If you are in the \u201cDesignated Countries\u201d, LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company (\u201cLinkedIn Ireland\u201d) will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services. If you are outside of the Designated Countries, LinkedIn Corporation will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with, our Services. As a Visitor or Member of our Services, the collection, use and sharing of your personal data is subject to this Privacy Policy and other documents referenced in this Privacy Policy, as well as updates.           LinkedIn (\u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) can modify this Privacy Policy, and if we make material changes to it, we will provide notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. If you object to any changes, you may\u00a0close your account. You acknowledge that your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to this Privacy Policy means that the collection, use and sharing of your personal data is subject to the updated Privacy Policy, as of its effective date.           To create an account you need to provide data including your name, email address and/or mobile number, general location (e.g., city), and a password. If you register for a premium Service, you will need to provide payment (e.g., credit card) and billing information.           You have\u00a0choices\u00a0about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo,\u00a0city or area\u00a0and endorsements. You don\u2019t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services, including helping recruiters and business opportunities find you. It\u2019s your choice whether to include\u00a0sensitive information\u00a0on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available.           We collect personal data from you when you provide, post or upload it to our Services, such as when you fill out a form, (e.g., with demographic data or\u00a0salary), respond to a survey, or submit a resume or fill out a job application on our Services. If you opt to import your address book, we receive your contacts (including contact information your service provider(s) or app automatically added to your address book when you communicated with addresses or numbers not already in your list). If you sync your contacts or calendars with our Services, we will collect your address book and calendar meeting information to keep growing your network by suggesting connections for you and others, and by providing information about events, e.g. times, places, attendees and contacts. You don\u2019t have to post or upload personal data; though if you don\u2019t, it may limit your ability to grow and engage with your network over our Services.           You and others may post content that includes information about you (as part of articles, posts, comments, videos) on our Services. We also may collect public information about you, such as professional-related news and accomplishments, and make it available as part of our Services, including, as permitted by your settings, in notifications to others of\u00a0mentions in the news.           We receive personal data (including contact information) about you when others import or sync their contacts or calendar with our Services, associate their contacts with Member profiles, scan and upload business cards, or send messages using our Services (including invites or connection requests). If you or others opt-in to sync email accounts with our Services, we will also collect \u201cemail header\u201d information that we can associate with Member profiles.           We receive personal data (e.g., your job title and work email address) about you when you use the services of our customers and partners, such as employers or prospective employers and applicant tracking systems providing us job application data. We receive data about you when you use some of the other services provided by us or our\u00a0affiliates, including Microsoft. For example, you may choose to send us information about your contacts in Microsoft apps and services, such as Outlook, for improved professional networking activities on our Services           We log usage data when you visit or otherwise use our Services, including our sites, app and platform technology, such as when you view or click on content (e.g., learning video) or ads (on or off our sites and apps), perform a search, install or update one of our mobile apps, share articles or apply for jobs. We use log-ins, cookies,\u00a0device information\u00a0and internet protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) addresses to identify you and log your use.           As further described in our\u00a0Cookie Policy, we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels and ad tags) to collect data (e.g., device IDs) to recognize you and your device(s) on, off and across different services and devices where you have engaged with our Services. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in our Cookie Policy. If you are outside the Designated Countries, we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your device where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can provide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness.\u00a0Learn more. You can opt out from our use of data from cookies and similar technologies that track your behavior on the sites of others for ad targeting and other ad-related purposes. For Visitors, the controls are here.           When you visit or leave our Services (including some plugins and our cookies or similar technology on the sites of others), we receive the URL of both the site you came from and the one you go to and the time of your visit. We also get information about your network and device (e.g., IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device identifier and features, cookie IDs and/or ISP, or your mobile carrier). If you use our Services from a mobile device, that device will send us data about your location based on your phone settings. We will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other\u00a0tools\u00a0to identify your precise location.           We collect information about you when you send, receive, or engage with messages in connection with our Services. For example, if you get a LinkedIn connection request, we track whether you have acted on it and will send you reminders. We also use\u00a0automatic scanning\u00a0technology on messages to support and protect our site. For example, we use this technology to suggest possible responses to messages and to manage or block content that violates our User Agreement or\u00a0Professional Community Policies\u00a0from our Services.           Others buying our Services for your use, such as your employer or your school, provide us with personal data about you and your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their workers, students or alumni. For example, we will get contact information for \u201cCompany Page\u201d administrators and for authorizing users of our premium Services, such as our recruiting, sales or learning products.           We receive information about your visits and interaction with services provided by others when you log-in with LinkedIn or visit others\u2019 services that include some of our plugins (such as \u201cApply with LinkedIn\u201d) or our ads, cookies or similar technologies.           Our Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we collect, use or share your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy. Affiliates are companies controlling, controlled by or under common control with us, including, for example, LinkedIn Ireland, LinkedIn Corporation, LinkedIn Singapore and Microsoft Corporation.           How we use your personal data will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the choices you make in your\u00a0settings. We use the data that we have about you to provide and personalize our Services, including with the help of automated systems and inferences we make, so that our Services (including ads) can be more relevant and useful to you and others.           We use your data to authorize access to our Services and honor your settings. Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional contacts. To do so, you can \u201cconnect\u201d with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to \u201cconnect\u201d with you. Subject to your and their\u00a0settings, when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others\u2019 connections in order to exchange professional opportunities. We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other\u00a0nearby\u00a0Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event). It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can\u00a0choose\u00a0whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections. Visitors have\u00a0choices\u00a0about how we use their data. Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your\u00a0settings, we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a\u00a0social action, used a feature, made new connections or were\u00a0mentioned in the news. Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a\u00a0specific task) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs or mentees, show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are\u00a0interested\u00a0in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services. Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your\u00a0settings\u00a0allow, we scan messages to provide \u201cbots\u201d or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps.\u00a0Learn more.     We sell premium Services that provide our customers and subscribers with customized-search functionality and tools (including messaging and activity alerts) as part of our talent, marketing and sales solutions. Customers can export limited information from your profile, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and general location (e.g., Dublin), such as to manage sales leads or talent, unless you\u00a0opt-out. We do not provide contact information to customers as part of these premium Services without your consent. Premium Services customers can store information they have about you in our premium Services, such as a resume or contact information or sales history. The data stored about you by these customers is subject to the policies of those customers. Other enterprise Services and features that use your data include\u00a0TeamLink\u00a0and\u00a0Elevate\u00a0(social promotion of content).           We will contact you through email, mobile phone, notices posted on our websites or apps, messages to your LinkedIn inbox, and other ways through our Services, including text messages and push notifications. We will send you messages about the availability of our Services, security, or other service-related issues. We also send messages about how to use our Services, network updates, reminders, job suggestions and promotional messages from us and our partners. You may change your communication\u00a0preferences\u00a0at any time. Please be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving service messages from us, including security and legal notices. We also enable\u00a0communications\u00a0between you and others through our Services, including for example\u00a0invitations,\u00a0InMail,\u00a0groups\u00a0and\u00a0messages\u00a0between connections.           We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of\u00a0partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined: We will show you ads called\u00a0sponsored content\u00a0which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as \u201cad\u201d or \u201csponsored\u201d). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your settings, if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services,\u00a0that action\u00a0may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown. We adhere to\u00a0self-regulatory principles\u00a0for interest-based advertising and participate in industry\u00a0opt-outs\u00a0from such ads. This does not opt you out of receiving advertising; you will continue to get other ads by advertisers not listed with these self regulatory tools. You can also\u00a0opt-out\u00a0specifically from our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. For Visitors, the setting is\u00a0here. We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. In such instances, we seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so.           In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members\u2019 data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services.           We use data, including public feedback, to conduct\u00a0research\u00a0and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity. We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these\u00a0jobs\u00a0and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under\u00a0controls\u00a0that are designed to protect your privacy. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data. Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may\u00a0opt-out\u00a0of survey invitations.           We use data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and for Service issues (e.g., bugs).           We use your data to produce and share insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your\u00a0data\u00a0to generate statistics about our members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on, or to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights.           We use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of our\u00a0User Agreement\u00a0and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors or others. E.g.\u00a0like, comment, follow,\u00a0share\u00a0 Partners include ad networks, exchanges and\u00a0others\u00a0           Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your\u00a0settings, it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third- party search engines). As detailed in our\u00a0Help Center, your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their\u00a0usage of our Services, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.           Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of\u00a0Sales Navigator\u00a0will be asked to share their \u201csocial selling index\u201d, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your\u00a0settings, when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services.           Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.             Subject to your\u00a0settings, other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may\u00a0revoke\u00a0the link with such accounts. Subject to your\u00a0settings, excerpts from your\u00a0profile\u00a0will appear on the services of others (e.g., search engine results, mail and calendar applications that show a user limited profile data of the person they are meeting or messaging,\u00a0social media aggregators, talent and lead managers). \u201cOld\u201d profile information remains on these services until they update their data cache with changes you made to your profile.           We will share your personal data with our affiliates to provide and develop our Services. We may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history.           We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and development). They will have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.           It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our\u00a0Data Request Guidelines\u00a0and\u00a0Transparency Report.           We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.           We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form.           We provide many\u00a0choices\u00a0about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your\u00a0profile\u00a0and controlling the visibility of your\u00a0posts\u00a0to advertising\u00a0opt-outs\u00a0and\u00a0communication\u00a0controls. We offer you\u00a0settings\u00a0to control and manage the personal data we have about you. For personal data that we have about you, you can: Visitors can learn more about how to make these requests\u00a0here. You may also contact us using the contact information below, and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws. Residents in the\u00a0Designated Countries\u00a0and\u00a0other regions\u00a0may have additional rights under their laws.           If you choose to close your\u00a0Linkedin\u00a0account, your personal data will generally stop being visible to others on our Services within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below. We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have\u00a0restricted\u00a0your account for breach of our\u00a0Professional Community Policies), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to \"unsubscribe\" from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed. Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search engine results) until they refresh their cache.           We implement security safeguards designed to protect your data, such as HTTPS. We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks. However, we cannot warrant the security of any information that you send us. There is no guarantee that data may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. Please visit our\u00a0Safety Center\u00a0for additional information about safely using our Services, including\u00a0two-factor authentication.           We process data both inside and outside of the United States and rely on legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders.\u00a0Learn more. Countries where we process data may have laws which are different from, and potentially not as protective as, the laws of your own country.           We will only collect and process personal data about you where we have lawful bases. Lawful bases include\u00a0consent(where you have given consent), contract (where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you (e.g., to deliver the LinkedIn Services you have requested) and \u201clegitimate interests.\u201d\u00a0Learn more. Where we rely on your consent to process personal data, you have the right to withdraw or decline your consent at any time and where we rely on legitimate interests, you have the right to object.\u00a0Learn More. If you have any questions about the lawful bases upon which we collect and use your personal data, please contact our Data Protection Officer\u00a0here.           We currently do not share personal data with third parties for their direct marketing purposes without your permission.\u00a0Learn more\u00a0about this and about our response to \u201cdo not track\u201d signals.           If you have questions or complaints regarding this Policy, please first\u00a0contact LinkedIn\u00a0online. You can also reach us by\u00a0physical mail. If contacting us does not resolve your complaint, you have more\u00a0options. Residents in the\u00a0Designated Countries\u00a0and\u00a0other regions\u00a0may also have the right to contact our Data Protection Officer\u00a0here. If this does not resolve your complaint, Residents in the\u00a0Designated Countries\u00a0and other regions may have more\u00a0options\u00a0under their laws. Where we process data based on consent, we will ask for your explicit consent.\u00a0You may withdraw your consent at any time, but that will not affect the lawfulness of the processing of your personal data prior to such withdrawal.\u00a0Where we rely on\u00a0contract, we will ask that you agree to the processing of personal data that is necessary for\u00a0entering into or\u00a0performance of your contract with us. We will rely on legitimate interests as a basis for data processing where the processing of your data is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.\u00a0"
